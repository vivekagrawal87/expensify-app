# Expense Management Application

This is React based expense managmenet application I have developed during Reactjs trainig. Using this application; user can add/modify/view expenses, filter expenses by date range and search text, sort them by amount and date.

During this application development, I have worked on:
1. State management using Redux
2. Google authentication using Google firebase
3. Storing expense data into Google firebase
4. Testing Reactjs application using Jest and Enzyme
